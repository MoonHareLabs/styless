# Styless - The unstyled and fully customizeable Jekyll theme
You can use your own styles or your favourite frontend frameworks with **Styless** Jekyll theme that is easily customizable and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Getting started
### Dependencies
Styless is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information. Styless requires no special plugins and can run on GitHub Pagesâ€™ standard Jekyll compiler. The [Jekyll SEO Tag plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) is included by default (no need to run any special installation) to inject SEO and open graph metadata on docs pages. For information on how to configure SEO and open graph metadata visit the [Jekyll SEO Tag usage guide](https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-seo-tag/usage/).
